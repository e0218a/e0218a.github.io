If you are reading this I succeeded! a.k.a **Hello World!**

Every day in 2023, I will be working on a fun software engineering task every day to stay excited about coding projects. **Today's fun task is starting a personal website.**

In order to get our page up and running super fast, we are going to set up the site using Github pages and Jekyll.

### Documentation:
1. In the Github Web UI, Go through the steps to create a new barebones repository. The repository title must follow the format
```<your username here!>.github.io```.
2. Add /index.md to the repository. The contents of this file will be your home page. We have elected to use this page's content to display blog posts. We used [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43120788/jekyll-display-all-posts-in-the-same-page) to generate the contents of this file.
4. Add /_config.yml to the repository. Use [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart#changing-the-title-and-description) to generate the contents of this file.
5. Navigate to your newly created repository's Github Web UI "Settings" page. Under the "Code and automation" section, select "Pages." A new settings configuration page should appear.
6. Find the "Building and deployment" section on the current settings configuratino page. Toggle "Source" to "Deploy from a branch". Toggle "Branch" to "main" and keep the default option ("/(root)") as the base folder for the site.
7. Find the link to the live site at the top of the current page. Refresh your page if you don't see this!
