title: Day 1/365 Tech Resolutions
---
If you are reading this I succeeded! a.k.a **Hello World!**

For every day this year I will be working on a fun coding task.

In order to get our page up and running super fast, we are going to set up the site using github pages and jekyll.

### Achievements Unlocked Today!
- Create a personal site
- Publish first blog post

### Documentation:
1. Go through the steps to create a new repository. The repository name must follow the format
```<your username here!>.github.io```. Include a license if you want!
2. Add /README.md to the repository. The contents of this file will be the home page of the site you are creating
3. Add /_config.yml following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart#changing-the-title-and-description)
4. Navigate to your newly created repository's "Settings". Under the "Code and automation" section, select "Pages." A new settings page should appear.
5. Find the "Building and deployment" section on the current page. Toggle **Source** to "Deploy from a branch". Toggle **Branch** to "main" and keep the default "/(root)" as the base folder for the site.
6. Find the link to the live site at the top of the current page. Refresh your page if you don't see this!
